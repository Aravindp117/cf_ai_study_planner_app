# Development Prompts - Agentic Study & Life Planner

This document contains the actual prompts used to build the Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects Study Planner application. These prompts were given to Cursor one phase at a time to guide the development process.

---

## PHASE 1: Data Models & Core Architecture

**Prompt:**
```
PHASE 1: Data Models & Core Architecture
I'm building an Agentic Study & Life Planner on Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects.

Create the following TypeScript data models and types:

1. **Goal Model**:
   - id: string
   - title: string
   - type: 'exam' | 'project' | 'commitment'
   - deadline: ISO date string
   - priority: 1-5 (5 = highest)
   - topics: array of Topic objects
   - status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'archived'
   - createdAt: ISO date string

2. **Topic Model**:
   - id: string
   - goalId: string (foreign key)
   - name: string
   - lastReviewed: ISO date string | null
   - reviewCount: number
   - masteryLevel: 0-100
   - notes: string

3. **StudySession Model**:
   - id: string
   - topicId: string
   - goalId: string
   - date: ISO date string
   - durationMinutes: number
   - notes: string

4. **DailyPlan Model**:
   - date: ISO date string
   - generatedAt: ISO date string
   - tasks: array of PlannedTask
   - reasoning: string (AI's explanation)

5. **PlannedTask Model**:
   - topicId: string
   - goalId: string
   - type: 'study' | 'review' | 'project_work'
   - estimatedMinutes: number
   - priority: 1-5
   - reasoning: string

6. **UserState Model** (this is what the Durable Object stores):
   - userId: string
   - goals: Goal[]
   - sessions: StudySession[]
   - dailyPlans: DailyPlan[]
   - lastPlanGenerated: ISO date string | null

Create these in a file called `src/types.ts` with proper TypeScript interfaces and helper functions for:
- Calculating memory decay level (green/yellow/orange/red) based on lastReviewed date
- Calculating spaced repetition intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days)
- Getting urgency score for a goal based on deadline and priority

Make it clean, well-commented, and ready for a Cloudflare Worker environment.
```

**Implementation**: Created `cf_ai_memchat/worker/src/types.ts` with all interfaces and helper functions.

---

## PHASE 2: Durable Object Implementation

**Prompt:**
```
PHASE 2: Durable Object Implementation
I have my data models defined. Now create a Durable Object class called `UserStateDO` that:

1. **Storage**:
   - Uses `this.state.storage` to persist UserState
   - Implements `getState()` and `setState()` methods
   - Auto-saves on every mutation

2. **Methods**:
   - `addGoal(goal: Omit<Goal, 'id' | 'createdAt'>)`: adds a new goal
   - `updateGoal(goalId: string, updates: Partial<Goal>)`: updates existing goal
   - `deleteGoal(goalId: string)`: removes a goal
   - `addTopic(goalId: string, topic: Omit<Topic, 'id' | 'goalId'>)`: adds topic to a goal
   - `recordSession(session: Omit<StudySession, 'id'>)`: logs a study session
   - `getTopicsNeedingReview(asOfDate?: string)`: returns topics sorted by urgency using spaced repetition
   - `generateDailyPlan(date: string, aiReasoning: string, tasks: PlannedTask[])`: stores AI-generated plan
   - `getDailyPlan(date: string)`: retrieves plan for a specific date
   - `getGoalsWithDecay()`: returns goals with memory decay colors for each topic

3. **Architecture**:
   - Use `this.ctx.waitUntil()` for async operations if needed
   - Handle race conditions properly
   - Return proper HTTP responses (200, 404, 400, etc.)
   - Include error handling

Put this in `src/durable-objects/UserStateDO.ts`.

Also create `src/durable-objects/index.ts` that exports the Durable Object for Wrangler.

Make sure it follows Cloudflare Durable Objects best practices.
```

**Implementation**: Created `cf_ai_memchat/worker/src/durable-objects/UserStateDO.ts` and `cf_ai_memchat/worker/src/durable-objects/index.ts`.

---

## PHASE 3: Worker API Routes

**Prompt:**
```
PHASE 3: Worker API Routes
Create a Cloudflare Worker with the following API routes. Use Hono for routing.

**Routes**:

1. `POST /api/goals` - Create new goal
   - Body: { title, type, deadline, priority, topics: string[] }
   - Returns: Goal object

2. `GET /api/goals` - List all active goals
   - Returns: Goal[] with memory decay indicators

3. `PUT /api/goals/:id` - Update goal
   - Body: Partial<Goal>

4. `DELETE /api/goals/:id` - Archive goal

5. `POST /api/sessions` - Record study session
   - Body: { topicId, goalId, durationMinutes, notes }
   - Updates lastReviewed and reviewCount for the topic

6. `GET /api/plan/:date` - Get daily plan for date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - If plan doesn't exist, return 404
   
7. `POST /api/plan/generate` - Generate today's plan using AI
   - Body: { date: string (optional, defaults to today) }
   - Calls LLM with user state
   - Stores generated plan
   - Returns: DailyPlan

8. `GET /api/review` - Get topics needing review (sorted by urgency)

**Architecture**:
- Each route gets userId from a header or query param (auth can be added later)
- Each route gets the Durable Object stub via: `env.USER_STATE.get(env.USER_STATE.idFromName(userId))`
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include error handling and validation

Create this in `src/index.ts` with clean, modular code.

Also update `wrangler.toml` to include:
```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "USER_STATE"
class_name = "UserStateDO"
script_name = "agentic-planner"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["UserStateDO"]

[ai]
binding = "AI"
```
```

**Note**: Phase 3 was later enhanced to include the existing chat endpoint (`POST /api/chat`) with command detection for `!today`, `!plan`, `!review`, `!goals`, etc. The plan generation was modified to use the existing Workers AI LLaMA model instead of requiring an external API.

**Implementation**: Created `cf_ai_memchat/worker/src/index.ts` with all routes using Hono, and updated `wrangler.json` (the project uses JSON format, not TOML).

---

## PHASE 4: AI Agent Module

**Prompt:**
```
Modified Phase 4 prompt:
Create an AI agent module that generates intelligent daily plans using the EXISTING Workers AI LLaMA model.

**File**: `src/agent/planner.ts`

**Function**: `generateDailyPlan(userState: UserState, targetDate: string, ai: Ai): Promise<DailyPlan>`

**Agent Logic**:

1. **Analyze user state** (same as before)

2. **Build LLM prompt** with:
   - System message: "You are a study planner AI for college students. Generate realistic daily plans."
   - User message with:
     - Today's date
     - All active goals with deadlines and priorities
     - Topics with memory decay status (green/yellow/orange/red)
     - Topics needing review
     - Recent study history (last 7 days)
   
3. **LLM Instructions** (in the prompt):
   - Create a realistic 4-6 hour daily study plan
   - Prioritize: (1) red/orange decay topics, (2) urgent deadlines, (3) high-priority goals
   - Mix review and new learning
   - Use spaced repetition principles
   - **IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
```json
   {
     "tasks": [
       {
         "topicId": "topic-123",
         "goalId": "goal-456",
         "type": "review",
         "estimatedMinutes": 45,
         "priority": 5,
         "reasoning": "This topic hasn't been reviewed in 15 days (red decay)"
       }
     ],
     "reasoning": "Overall plan explanation focusing on urgent items first..."
   }
```

4. **Call Workers AI** (your existing binding):
```typescript
   const response = await ai.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
     messages: [
       { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
       { role: 'user', content: userPrompt }
     ],
     temperature: 0.7,
     max_tokens: 1500
   });
```

5. **Parse LLM response**:
   - Extract JSON from response (handle markdown code blocks if present)
   - Validate tasks structure
   - Return DailyPlan object

**Also create**: `src/agent/prompts.ts` with prompt templates.

Make sure to handle cases where LLaMA doesn't return perfect JSON (add retry logic or JSON extraction helpers).
```

**Implementation**: Created `cf_ai_memchat/worker/src/agent/planner.ts` and `cf_ai_memchat/worker/src/agent/prompts.ts` with robust JSON parsing and error handling.

## PHASE 5: React Frontend

**Prompt:**
```
PHASE 5: Frontend Components (React + TypeScript)
Create a React frontend (using Vite) with these components:

**Pages**:
1. `DashboardPage.tsx` - Main view showing today's plan, goals overview, urgent reviews
2. `GoalsPage.tsx` - List and manage goals
3. `CalendarPage.tsx` - Simple week/month view with planned tasks
4. `ChatPage.tsx` - Chat interface with command support

**Components**:
1. `GoalCard.tsx` - Display goal with deadline countdown, topics with decay colors
2. `DailyPlanView.tsx` - Show today's AI-generated plan with task list
3. `TopicDecayIndicator.tsx` - Visual indicator (green/yellow/orange/red dot or bar)
4. `StudySessionModal.tsx` - Form to log a completed study session
5. `CommandChat.tsx` - Chat with command parsing (!today, !plan, !review, !goals)

**Commands** (parse in frontend, call API):
- `!today` → Shows today's plan
- `!plan` → Generates new plan for today
- `!review` → Shows topics needing review
- `!goals` → Lists active goals
- `!add goal [title]` → Creates new goal (follow-up prompts for details)
- `!log [topicName] [minutes]` → Logs study session

**State Management**:
- Use React Context or Zustand for global state
- Fetch data from Worker API
- Real-time updates after actions

**Styling**:
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Clean, student-friendly UI
- Mobile-responsive

Create these in `src/components/` and `src/pages/`.

Include a `src/api/client.ts` with typed fetch helpers for all API routes.
```

**Implementation**: Created all frontend pages and components in `frontend/src/`, including React Context for state management and a complete API client.

## PHASE 6: Calendar & Memory Visualization

**Prompt:**
```
PHASE 6: Calendar & Memory Visualization
Add two advanced features:

**1. Calendar Component** (`src/components/Calendar.tsx`):
- Show current week by default (expandable to month view)
- Display planned tasks as colored blocks
- Color by priority (red = high, yellow = medium, green = low)
- Click task to see details
- Click empty slot to add ad-hoc study session
- Use `date-fns` for date manipulation
- Fetch plans via `GET /api/plan/:date` for each visible date

**2. Memory Decay Visualization** (`src/components/MemoryMatrix.tsx`):
- Grid or list view of all topics across all goals
- Each topic shows:
  - Name
  - Goal it belongs to
  - Last reviewed date
  - Memory decay color (green < 3 days, yellow 3-7 days, orange 7-14 days, red > 14 days)
  - Review count
  - Next suggested review date
- Sort by urgency (red topics first)
- Click topic to log review session

**Helper functions** (`src/utils/memory.ts`):
- `getDecayColor(lastReviewed: string | null): 'green' | 'yellow' | 'orange' | 'red'`
- `getNextReviewDate(lastReviewed: string, reviewCount: number): string` (spaced repetition)
- `getUrgencyScore(topic: Topic): number` (for sorting)

Make both components clean, performant, and visually intuitive.
```

**Implementation**: Created `frontend/src/components/Calendar.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/MemoryMatrix.tsx`, and `frontend/src/utils/memory.ts` with all requested functionality.

## PHASE 7: Integration & Polish

**Prompt:**
```
PHASE 7: Integration & Polish
Final integration phase:

1. **Command Parser** (`src/utils/commands.ts`):
   - Parse chat messages starting with `!`
   - Extract command and arguments
   - Return structured command object
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Chat Integration** (update `ChatPage.tsx`):
   - Send normal messages to LLM (conversational AI)
   - Intercept commands and execute via API
   - Display command results in chat
   - Show AI-generated plan reasoning in chat

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add try-catch to all API calls
   - Show toast notifications for errors
   - Add loading states to all async operations
   - Handle offline gracefully

4. **Navigation** (`src/App.tsx`):
   - React Router with routes: /, /goals, /calendar, /chat
   - Sidebar navigation
   - Active route highlighting

5. **Environment Setup**:
   - `wrangler.toml` configured correctly
   - `vite.config.ts` with proxy to local worker dev server
   - `.env` for API base URL
   - README.md with setup instructions

6. **Testing Setup** (optional but recommended):
   - `src/__tests__/memory.test.ts` - test decay calculations
   - `src/__tests__/commands.test.ts` - test command parsing

7. **Deployment**:
   - Cloudflare Pages for frontend
   - Cloudflare Worker for backend
   - Update `wrangler.toml` with production settings

Make sure all pieces connect properly and the app is production-ready.
```

**Implementation**: Created command parser, integrated chat, added error handling with toast notifications, set up React Router navigation, configured environment files, and added test files. The application is production-ready.

## Additional Prompts & Fixes

### Button Debugging Prompt

**Prompt:**
```
I have a Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects + React frontend app that's having issues with all button interactions. All buttons are either doing nothing or returning errors like "internal server error" or "goal not found".

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. "Create Goal" button - internal server error
2. "Generate Plan" button - does nothing
3. "Regenerate Plan" button - internal server error
4. "Delete Goal" button - "goal not found" error

I need you to create a COMPLETE, WORKING debugging and fix implementation.

STEP 1: Create proper error logging and debugging infrastructure
STEP 2: Fix the Durable Object with proper error handling and logging
STEP 3: Fix Worker API routes with comprehensive error handling
STEP 4: Fix frontend API client with retry logic and detailed error messages
STEP 5: Fix React components with proper async handling
STEP 6: Ensure Durable Object binding is correct
STEP 7: Add CORS properly
STEP 8: Create a health check route

[... full prompt details ...]
```

**Result**: Comprehensive debugging infrastructure was added, error handling was improved throughout the codebase, and all button interactions were fixed.

### Memory & State Documentation

**Note**: The user also requested documentation explaining that the application maintains both conversation memory (via Memory Durable Object) and study planner state (via UserStateDO Durable Object). See `MEMORY_STATE_DOCUMENTATION.md` for details.
